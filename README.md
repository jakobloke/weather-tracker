# weather-tracker
 
This web application was created to allow an individual to see the 5 day weather forecast in a city.

When the user searches for a city then the weather conditions for current time and future conditions will appear, and that city will be added to a history bar on the left hand side of the site.
There are pictures as well to go along with the weather forecasts to give the user a visual experience as well.
When the city is clicked again in the history you may view the weather data for it.


You can find the website deployed at https://jakobloke.github.io/weather-tracker/
